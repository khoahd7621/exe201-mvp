# Experiential Entrepreneurship MVP - CHINESE LEARNING PLATFORM

### Overview

- Currently, there are so many applications that support learning Chinese out there.
  One of the most limitations is each of them only focuses on a specific skill,
  making learners take time to find suitable applications when they want to improve other skills.
  On the other hand, some applications support everything all at once but the
  fee is very high. As a start-up in the Education field, especially in Chinese learning,
  our mission is to provide a solution that centralizes all skills in one application with
  optimized cost.
- Mission is clear, but resources and experiences are limited along with a meager duration of 10 weeks
  of subject. We can't make this mission come true. So we just cloned an MVP based on existed Chinese
  learning application [Hanzii](https://hanzii.net) with the target is MVP can run and deliver to the user,
  and we pass the subject. That's it.
